                    The question of adopting Hindi as the National Language of India has been debated for a long time
                    now. In this
                    simulation of the AIPPM, delegates will discuss the need for a national language.

                                Dear members of the AIPPM,
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                My name is Sanya Puri and I am honoured to be the moderator of the All India Political
                                Parties Meet (AIPPM). I recently gave my class 12th CBSE board exams. I have been
                                involved in Model UN since I was in school. I attended my first conference in grade 8.
                                MUNs have enabled me to hone a wide variety of skills ranging from communication to
                                critical thinking. To facilitate a high-quality debate, it is necessary that you are
                                thoroughly versed with the portfolios of the individuals and the parties that you
                                represent. Remember that you may face severe opposition by other representatives for
                                various arguments and decisions that you make, but it is your ability to be able to
                                stand your ground that counts. While addressing the issue at hand, I expect a certain
                                level of decorum in the committee. Lastly, I encourage you all to utilize as much
                                original thinking as possible. I hope you all enjoy these three days!
                            </p>

                                "All autobiographies are lies"; so said the great playwright G.B Shaw , yet
                                here I am trying to present
                                myself to you in the most objective and honest avatar as I possibly can.
                                I have often been described as an inquisitive mind having a plethora of interests. Apart
                                from MUNing
                                which I am extremely passionate about and have actively been participating since 2019, I
                                have a great
                                interest in history (yes, I did want to become an archaeologist for the longest time)
                                with a slight bias
                                towards medieval India.
                                If not MUNing you will find me in the drama room frantically trying to organise a play
                                or two. I have an
                                unending love story with theatre. In appreciation of my ability as a theatre artist I
                                have been fetted in
                                various foras. You will rarely ever find me separated from my headphones which is
                                something extremely
                                dear to my heart.
                                With a slightly concerning obsession with consuming true crime content in any form
                                whether it be
                                reading books, watching documentaries or listening to podcasts. That a particular
                                interest in debating
                                across varied platforms, and the need to see justice delivered, has contributed a
                                siginificant amount in my
                                gradual love for law over the recent years. 10 years down the line I hope to be making a
                                difference to the
                                lives of deserving undertrials through my legal practice.
                                You can always approach me whether it is to seek advice regarding school, have animated
                                rants about
                                your favourite celebrity or discuss the causes and solutions of the European migrant
                                crisis!
                                All of this is to say meet Nandini Chaudhry, just another 11th grader and also your vice
                                chair for the All
                                Indian Political Party Meet for the Interschool Step by Step MUN 2022.

                                My name is Shivom Singh, and I have been granted the privilege of serving as your
                                rapporteur for the All
                                India Political Parties Meet at SBSMUN 2022.
                                I am currently in grade 10 pursuing IGCSE with greater focus towards commerce and
                                humanities. Apart
                                from MUN, I have varied interests, I am deeply invested in politics, poetry and
                                dramatics. I am an ardent
                                supporter of Liverpool Football Club (and Kanye West, but we won’t talk about that).
                                I have been pursuing MUN since I was 11, so I’d like to think that I am somewhat
                                experienced. I began
                                my journey as a delegate who spoke in favour of the wrong party and was berated by the
                                EB for a good
                                half hour, so, it feels rather full circle, to be sitting on the chair of the EB today
                                (hopefully not berating
                                one of you, though). MUN to me is more than the certificates or gavels you will win.
                                Now, this will
                                sound extremely cliche, but ,MUN is truly about friendship, learning and most
                                importantly understanding
                                different perspectives. I hope to aid you all in your experience of MUNning and make
                                this MUN a
                                memorable one.
