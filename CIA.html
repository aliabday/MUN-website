                <br>
                <p>
                    Salvador Guillermo Allende Gossens, the 28th President of Chile has introduced measures to
                    nationalize industries, expand education and improve living conditions through government
                    interventions. The United States of America is alarmed by these developments and the CIA is keeping
                    a close watch on the situation

                                Dear members of the AIPPM,
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                My name is Sanya Puri and I am honoured to be the moderator of the All India Political
                                Parties Meet (AIPPM). I recently gave my class 12th CBSE board exams. I have been
                                involved in Model UN since I was in school. I attended my first conference in grade 8.
                                MUNs have enabled me to hone a wide variety of skills ranging from communication to
                                critical thinking. To facilitate a high-quality debate, it is necessary that you are
                                thoroughly versed with the portfolios of the individuals and the parties that you
                                represent. Remember that you may face severe opposition by other representatives for
                                various arguments and decisions that you make, but it is your ability to be able to
                                stand your ground that counts. While addressing the issue at hand, I expect a certain
                                level of decorum in the committee. Lastly, I encourage you all to utilize as much
                                original thinking as possible. I hope you all enjoy these three days!
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Wish you all the very best.

                                The name's Puljal, Anoushka Puljal, and I shall be serving as your vice chair in
                                simulation of the CIA
                                Crisis Cabinet at the Step By Step School Inter MUN, 2022. We shall be taken back in
                                time to the 1973
                                Coup d&#39; Etat in Chile, and shall possibly be the ones masterminding it (who knows).
                                I am currently studying in grade 11 in the IB curriculum with Biology, Chemistry and
                                English Literature
                                at Higher Level and History, French and Mathematics at Standard Level. Interestingly,
                                though my passion
                                is very science oriented (I aspire to be a veterinarian), as can be clearly inferred
                                from my subject choices,
                                I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for history and politics, and I find MUN is the perfect
                                amalgamation of that.
                                That when induced into a crisis committee creates a wonderland for me where I can
                                debate, research and
                                imaginate in balance. Crisis committees are therefore nuanced in a way no other
                                committee can be as it
                                stimulates both the creative and logical sides of your brain.
                                Through this simulation of the crisis committee, I look forward to a session filled with
                                fervent
                                questioning, substantial research, quick thinking and resolution building and finally,
                                well articulated
                                debate. &quot;I don&#39;t expect people to just sit there and agree with me,&quot; as
                                Margret Thatcher said, and I agree
                                with her. I hope that everyone comes to the committee with their own individual opinions
                                and ideas on
                                how to tackle the issue of Allende&#39;s socialist government.

                                SBSMUN2019.

                                Efficient, hardworking, funny (somewhat) and intelligent. That’s Jai in a nutshell. He’s
                                the guy you’ll
                                always catch cheering on the Bucks or furiously trying to finish his homework. He’s the
                                typical “Sharma
                                ji ka beta,” excelling academically, being a part of every school sports team or heading
                                a certain event.
                                The perfect mixture of diplomat and Vladimir Putin, Jai’s a top tier munner. He’s won
                                accolades at
                                several conferences , the most notable being a best delegate at Yale Mun Taiwan, 2022.
                                He’s extremely
                                approachable and can always be looked upto for help.
                                Having him around you is like having coffee infused with chamomile extract. He’s
                                basically chaotically
                                calm and that’s why he can always be asked for rational advice. If you have any doubts
                                related to MUNs
                                or other important things (why James Harden is kinda overrated) please feel free to ask
                                him.
